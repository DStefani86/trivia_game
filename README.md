# JavaScript Quiz Game!!

## Description

I created a small Trivia game that scrolls through the questions at random once the timer begins. If the answer given is incorrect the timer will be docked 15 seconds. Winners may enter their names to be accompanied with their score on the leaderboard.

Once you have located the repository, click the clone button. Clone the SSH to your local terminal.

## Usage

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project. The following is a few examples of pieces of code that took a little bit longer to make or felt satisfying once acheived. My first step was to create the arrays for all the questions and answer.

<br>
After that was completed, I made a start button to initiate the game. Once the start button is pressed the timer begins to count down.

The button in question..

Up next is the function I used to decrease the time left and keep score of the game. I learned a lot about timers during this process. You can see some code commented out that ultimately went inside a different container.

The code doesn't make the questions visible until the quiz is started.

This picture of my container with all the options in it and I decided to match the answer to whatever button the user selects.

<br>
<br>
I didn't want to screenshot the entire code but the last example easily took the most brainpower. This function includes the prompt for the user to enter their name. This is also where I add the user's score to the local storage. I made an array out the JSON string and then call it back in my FOR loop. The FOR loop then creates a new entry in the list and each additional entry is appended onto the list.

Finally, a shot of the leaderboard after the game is completed.
